# MembranePotential_project
This application is using the Nernst and the Goldmann equations to calculate the neuron membrane potentials.
You can modify the extra- and intracellular ion concentratios with slidebars or with buttons to achieve more precision.

You can visualize the changes you have made to the potentials in a graph, and you can see their exact values under the slidebars.

Have fun  :)
