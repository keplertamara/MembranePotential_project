# MembranePotential_project
This application is using the Nerst and the Goldmann equations to calculate the neuron membrane potentials.
You can modify the extra and intracellular ion concentratios with slidebars or with buttons to achive more precision.

You can visualize the changes you have made to potential in a graph, and you can see their exact values under the slidebars.

Have fun  :)
